## Photoprocessing

## Need to solve

Extrac and transform image to official document picture for with face detection and cut in official measurements

### Use of model

Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location.

This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time. We can train a haar-cascade detector to detect various objects like cars, bikes, buildings, fruits, etc

In this time, going to use different pre trained models in with different features for identify the face of each person, and transform this image with a specific length, finally with the use of the math funtion create an area for cut the picture.
